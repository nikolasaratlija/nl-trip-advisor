## Netherlands-Trip-Advisor

https://nikolasaratlija.github.io/nl-trip-advisor-react

The purpose of this website is to attract tourists by providing them with a way to see what you can do in this country.
So far, visitors can view tourist locations (WIP) but I also want to do events, bookings and perhaps even more.

Originally I made this project solely for a school assignment,
but I decided to keep working on this project as an attempt to teach myself about the React.js framework.

If you feel like contributing or giving me tips, feel free to; all help is appreciated.
