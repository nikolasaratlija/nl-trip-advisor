## Netherlands-Trip-Advisor

Check it out on: https://nikolasaratlija.github.io/nl-trip-advisor/

Originally I made this project solely for a school assignment but I decided to keep working on this as an attempt to teach myself about the React.js framework and to be an addition to my portfolio (which I don't officially have yet).

Not too long ago this project underwent an overhaul which mostly affected the UI design. I wasn't too happy with the UI and UX of the website prior to the overhaul. It was very unlike your average website which, due to my nonexistant experience in web-design, made it hard for me to create a design that I deemed adequate, but now the website has a more traditional SPA design.

As far as the actual 'product' I'm creating here: its purpose is to attract tourists by showcasing things you can do or visit in this country; such as tourist-locations, events and hopefully more in the future.

If you feel like contributing or giving me tips, feel free to; all help is appreciated.
